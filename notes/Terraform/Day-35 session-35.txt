Day-35 session-35(01/10/2024)
------------------------------
Recap:
------
-> we have created VPC, Sg 
-> we have created bastion server in frontend subnet and so we will host to bastion server first and from that we can connect to private instances  
-> It is hard to maintain the RDS in ec2 instances for upgrades, storage auto-scaling, high availability and data replication -> It is hard to maintain these all by manually -> for this we have used RDS in AWS 

-> we have discussed about load balancer, load balancer will provide the load to instances based on there availability and health checks 
-> we will keep all the instances in a target group where we have a listeners and rules 

Now in today's class:
----------------------
we have two types of infrastrures

1. project infra -> it is compared as basement of the house -> rare changes 
2. Application infra  -> Rooms and walls -> yes, they can change 


Project infra:
--------------
VPC -> it will not change frequently 
security groups -> SG may not change only the rules might change
Bastion host -> no frequent changes -> it is static 
Databases -> No frequent changes -> rarely after years it will get updated 
Load balancer -> no frequent changes 

-> These all are mandatory to run any application and these all are comes under project infra 

Application infra 
-----------------
ec2 instances 
target groups 

These are all may change when version of packages might change in application infra 

In AWS, the first request we will get to load balancer -> 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS
-> from load balancer to frontend servers - with port 80 
-> from frontend server to backend load balancer 
-> and then backend server only accepts from backend load balancer with port 8080
-> from backend server to RDS mysql server with 3306 port number 

-> bastion server connects to frontend server with ports 22 and 80 
-> bastion server connects to backend load balancer with port 80 
-> bastion server connects to backend server with ports with 8080 and 22
-> bastion server connects to backend server with port 3306
-> bastion server is hosted by employees 


backend-dev.daws81s.online --> LB 
backend-dev.daws81s.online:8080

Load balancer:
--------------
LB -> distributing the load to taret group -> team lead
TG -> A team of members -> A group of servers 
server -> Team member -> server 
Listener -> Team lead phone number -> port LB listening to 
Rules -> we have two conditions in rules 
1. Host path and context path 

Host path and context path
---------------------------
-> suppose, Bussiness analyst gets work from client 
-> BA should analyse the work and gives to Architect 
-> And architect assigns to backend team -> backend LB -> Backend Team lead 
-> frontend -> frontend LB -> frontend team lead 
database -> database team lead 

host path
----------
backend.daws81s.fun -> backend LB 
frontend.daws81s.fun -> frontend lB 

classic LB 
application LB --> layer 7 
network LB 

m.facebook.com --> mobile site 
facebook.com --> web site 

context path 
-------------
daws81s.online/backend 
daws81s.online/frontend 

app ALB --> app tier LB 
web ALB --> web tier LB 

mysql.dev.daws81s.fun -> points to end point in RDS 

Open Route53 
enter mysql-dev and select CNAME 
name is fixed but end point might change 

app-dev.daws81s.online -> App ALB 
web-dev.daws81s.online -> web ALB 

app-dev.daws81s.online
----------------------
app-dev.daws81s.online -> it will respond -> default response
backend.app-dev.daws81s.fun --> forward this request to backend TG
