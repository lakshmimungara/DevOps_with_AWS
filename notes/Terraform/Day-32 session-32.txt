Day-32 session-32(26/09/2024)
------------------------------
Recap:
------
VPC module 
-> In AWS account -> we created our own VPC 
-> In two different availability zones 
-> we created a subnets - public, private and database 
-> we created internet gateway 
-> we created route tables for public, private and database 
-> we have destination 0.0.0.0/0 for Internet gateway and target is to local 10.0.0.0/16 --> this is for public subnets 
-> we have destination 0.0.0.0/0 for NAt gateway and target is to local 10.0.0.0/16 --> this is for private subnets 

-> we have destination 0.0.0.0/0 for NAT gateway and target is to local 10.0.0.0/16 --> this is for database subnets 

-> we connected to another VPC by using peering connection 
-> So for this, destination is 172.31.0.0/1 with peering connection in public, private and database 
-> In another default VPC, we have public subnet with local 172.31.0.0/1 and peering 10.0.0.0/16 and internet gatway access 0.0.0.0/0 for public route table


Now, in today's class
---------------------
-> In any new project, first we need to create VPC network and then firewalls 
-> And for that we need to create security group 

How to use git terraform module?
---------------------------------
-> Source has to target the git 
-> we can maintain different branches as well
-> when we have done any changes in module, in vpc_test first we have to target the other branch after that we test it and complete 

source = "git::<url>?ref=main"
By using this, it pulls the module from git directly no need to be in workspace

-> after completion of module, that we will keep in git and use it 

-> Till now, we used default VPC and default security groups by allowing all 

-> But in companies, in projects we will not allow everything becoz of secuirty firewall 

-> we should maintain VPC, SG, MySQL, Backend, frontend in a seperate repos 


-> Now, I am going to create different folders in one repo and we can read them as seperate repos 

-> whenever we do any changes in module first we should reconfigure that module 

-> After completion of module we keep in git and use it 

-> name for security group should be like this --> expense-dev-mysql,expense-dev-private and expense-dev-public 

seperate repos for each - expense-vpc, expense-sg, expense-mysql etc 

-> centralized - all computers are connecting to git 
-> centralize place - where we can get everything 
-> Here, somethinmg like SSM parameter store 

-> for example: amazon is the mediator/point of contact between buyer and seller 
-> Likewise, VPC keeps all the details which are required by customers in SSM store 
-> Sg takes from SSM store 
-> SG places all the details required for public are placed in SSM store and backend takes from ssm store 
-> SSM parameter store is like a key-value 


ssm parameter store
--------------------
-> which stores key-value 
It should start with forword slash --> /expense/dev.vpc_id 

Open AWS -> search for system manager -> go to parameter store -> enter the name(should starts with slash(/)) - /expense/dev/vpc_id -> store the value - vpc-1234 -> click on create parameter 

expense-vpc 
expense-sg 
expense-mysql 

your repo:
-----------
module "your_name"{
		args_as_per_module_definition = your_value 
		enable_dns_hostnames = var.dns_hostnames 
}

variables.tf 
------------
variable "dns_hostnames"{
default = false 
}


outputs.tf:
----------
module.your_name.<output-paramater-name>		
modules 
1. custom module2. open source modules
