Day-12 session-12(27/08/2024)

Recap:
------
1. variables --> It is comes under DRY concept, whenever you feel that one thing is repeating again again then that value can be placed in a variable and it can be used everywhere
-> It is a central place, if you change one variable and it can used everywhere 

2. data types
3. conditions -> it depends on condistions and decisions. It is very generic thing 
4. functions -> If frequently you want to do same work repeatedly, then we use functions 
5. Loops

colors -> It is for user experience 
exit status:
------------
success -> 0 
failure -> 1 to 127 

Now, we are going look into loops

1. create a file 14-loops.sh 
2. print 0 to 10 numbers 
Loops are very important for coding

general syntax for loops:
---------------------------
for(int i=0;i<100;i++)
{
print i;
}

syntax in shell-scripting:
--------------------------
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
do 
	echo $i 
done 
Redirections:
---------------
ls -l > output.txt --> by default it redirects only success o/p 
1 --> success 
2 --> failure 

ls -l 2>output.txt --> redirects only failure/error output
ls -l 1>output.txt
ls -l &>output.txt --> either it may be success or failure keep in output.txt 

/var/log/shell-script/16-redictors-<timestamp>.log

-> file name is 16-redirectors.sh --> I want this as 16-redirectors

-> write logs on both terminal and logfile 
Important messages should be printed on terminal and in file also. So, for this purpose we use tee command 

tee command -> It writes logs to multiple destinations

Idempotency:
------------
-> If you run a program for infinite times, it should not change the result

CRUD 
creation --> check if it is already created or not 
Read --> No issues on read command
Update --> No issues on updations of same thing 
Delete --> No issue, if it is not existed or already deleted 

Check already mysql root password id setup or not, if setup you can tell already done... otherwise setup it
